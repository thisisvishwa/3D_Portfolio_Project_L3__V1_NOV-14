# Implementation Details

This document provides a detailed explanation of how each feature is implemented in the 3D Portfolio Project, including both front-end and back-end aspects.

## 1. Achievement System

### Front-End Implementation

The `BadgeDisplay` component in `src/components/BadgeDisplay.js` dynamically renders badges based on user achievements. It uses React hooks, `useState` and `useEffect`, for fetching and displaying the badges. The `Tooltip` component in `src/components/Tooltip.js` is used for displaying badge descriptions.

### Back-End Implementation

The `Badge` schema in `server/models/Badge.js` tracks user achievements, including fields like `userID`, `badgeID`, `dateEarned`, and `isUnlocked`. The `badgeRoutes` in `server/routes/badgeRoutes.js` handle API endpoints for retrieving and updating badge data.

## 2. Progress Tracking

### Front-End Implementation

The `ProgressBar` component in `src/components/ProgressBar.js` uses React state hooks to track user progress and dynamically update the progress bar.

### Back-End Implementation

The `Progress` schema in `server/models/Progress.js` stores user progress data. The `progressRoutes` in `server/routes/progressRoutes.js` manage progress data.

## 3. Interactive Challenges

### Front-End Implementation

The `MiniGame` component in `src/components/MiniGame.js` uses Phaser.js for game logic, integrated with React for UI components.

### Back-End Implementation

The `Game` schema in `server/models/Game.js` stores game results and user interactions. The `gameRoutes` in `server/routes/gameRoutes.js` handle game data.

## 4. Rewards

### Front-End Implementation

The `Reward` component in `src/components/Reward.js` displays available and earned rewards and provides interactive UI elements for reward redemption.

### Back-End Implementation

The `Reward` schema in `server/models/Reward.js` tracks user rewards. The `rewardRoutes` in `server/routes/rewardRoutes.js` manage reward logic.

## 5. Feedback System

### Front-End Implementation

Feedback is provided using animations, modals, or toast notifications in React.

### Back-End Implementation

Server-side logic for triggering appropriate feedback based on user actions is implemented.

## 6. Easter Eggs

### Front-End Implementation

UI components that are not immediately visible or are revealed under certain conditions are implemented for Easter eggs.

### Back-End Implementation

Server-side logic to track if and when a user discovers an Easter egg is implemented.

## 7. Leaderboard or Community Features

### Front-End Implementation

The `Leaderboard` component in `src/components/Leaderboard.js` displays the leaderboard, updating in real-time or upon page refresh.

### Back-End Implementation

The `Leaderboard` schema in `server/models/Leaderboard.js` stores user scores and leaderboard data. The `leaderboardRoutes` in `server/routes/leaderboardRoutes.js` handle leaderboard logic.

## 8. User Choice and Branching Paths

### Front-End Implementation

UI elements to facilitate user choices and dynamically alter the content based on these choices are implemented.

### Back-End Implementation

Logic to serve different content based on user choices is developed, potentially storing these preferences in MongoDB for returning users.

## 9. Narrative Elements

### Front-End Implementation

UI components that present narrative elements in an engaging manner are created.

### Back-End Implementation

Server-side logic for progressing through the narrative is implemented, possibly storing user progress in MongoDB.

## 10. Social Sharing

### Front-End Implementation

Social media sharing buttons and functionality are integrated.

### Back-End Implementation

Backend support for social sharing features is provided, if needed.
