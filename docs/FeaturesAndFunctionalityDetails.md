# Features and Functionality Details

## 1. Achievement System

The Achievement System is implemented using a `BadgeDisplay` React component that dynamically renders badges based on user achievements. The state of the component is managed using React hooks, `useState` and `useEffect`, for fetching and displaying the badges. The badges are styled using CSS/SASS and are arranged using flexbox or grid layouts for responsive design.

On the back-end, a MongoDB schema is used to track user achievements. The schema includes fields like `userID`, `badgeID`, `dateEarned`, and `isUnlocked`. Express routes are used to handle API requests for retrieving and updating badge data. Server-side logic checks conditions for earning badges, updates the database, and handles edge cases.

## 2. Progress Tracking

Progress Tracking is implemented using a `ProgressBar` React component that fills as users visit different sections. The state of the component is managed using React hooks to track user progress and dynamically update the progress bar.

On the back-end, MongoDB is used to store user progress data and Express routes are used to manage this data.

## 3. Interactive Challenges

Interactive Challenges are designed as mini-games. The game logic is implemented using Phaser.js and is integrated with React for UI components.

On the back-end, game results and user interactions are stored in MongoDB and game data is handled with Express.js.

## 4. Rewards

The Rewards system allows users to earn rewards after collecting specific badges or completing tasks. Rewards are displayed using a `Reward` React component and interactive UI elements are used for reward redemption.

On the back-end, a MongoDB schema is used to track user rewards and Express routes are used to manage reward logic.

## 5. Feedback System

The Feedback System provides immediate visual and auditory feedback for user actions. Feedback is provided using animations, modals, or toast notifications in React.

On the back-end, server-side logic is used to trigger appropriate feedback based on user actions.

## 6. Easter Eggs

Easter Eggs are hidden features or content that can be discovered by users. These are implemented using UI components that are not immediately visible or are revealed under certain conditions.

On the back-end, server-side logic is used to track if and when a user discovers an Easter egg.

## 7. Leaderboard or Community Features

The Leaderboard displays top users based on their achievements or points. The leaderboard is displayed using a `Leaderboard` React component that updates in real-time or upon page refresh.

On the back-end, a MongoDB schema is used to store user scores and leaderboard data and Express routes are used for leaderboard logic.

## 8. User Choice and Branching Paths

The system allows users to choose their exploration path through the portfolio, affecting the content they see. UI elements are designed and implemented to facilitate user choices and dynamically alter the content based on these choices.

On the back-end, logic is developed to serve different content based on user choices, potentially storing these preferences in MongoDB for returning users.

## 9. Narrative Elements

A storyline or narrative is designed that integrates with the portfolio's content. UI components are created to present narrative elements in an engaging manner.

On the back-end, server-side logic is used for progressing through the narrative, possibly storing user progress in MongoDB.

## 10. Social Sharing

Users are enabled to share their achievements or portfolio content on social media platforms. Social media sharing buttons and functionality are integrated on the front-end.

On the back-end, support is provided for social sharing features, if needed.
