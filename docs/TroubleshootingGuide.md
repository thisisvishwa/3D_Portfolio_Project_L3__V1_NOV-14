# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions to some common issues you might encounter while using the 3D Portfolio Project.

## 1. Badges not displaying

If badges are not displaying, it could be due to a problem with fetching data from the server. Check the console for any error messages. If there are server-side errors, refer to the server logs for more details.

## 2. Progress bar not updating

If the progress bar is not updating as you navigate through the portfolio, ensure that the React state is being updated correctly. If the issue persists, check the server-side logic for managing progress data.

## 3. Mini-games not loading

If the mini-games are not loading, it could be due to an issue with Phaser.js. Ensure that Phaser.js is properly installed and imported in your project. If the issue persists, check the console for any error messages.

## 4. Rewards not unlocking

If rewards are not unlocking after completing tasks or collecting badges, check the server-side logic for managing reward data. Ensure that the conditions for unlocking rewards are being checked and updated correctly.

## 5. Feedback not triggering

If feedback is not triggering after certain user actions, ensure that the server-side logic for triggering feedback is working correctly. Check the console for any error messages.

## 6. Easter eggs not functioning

If Easter eggs are not functioning as intended, check the front-end implementation for any issues. If the issue persists, check the server-side logic for tracking Easter eggs.

## 7. Leaderboard not updating

If the leaderboard is not updating, check the server-side logic for leaderboard data. Ensure that user scores are being updated and retrieved correctly.

## 8. Content not changing based on user choices

If the content is not changing based on user choices, ensure that the front-end implementation is correctly altering the content. If the issue persists, check the server-side logic for serving different content based on user choices.

## 9. Narrative not progressing

If the narrative is not progressing, check the server-side logic for narrative progression. Ensure that user progress is being tracked and updated correctly.

## 10. Social sharing not working

If social sharing is not working, ensure that the front-end implementation for social sharing buttons is correct. If the issue persists, check if the backend support for social sharing features is working correctly.
